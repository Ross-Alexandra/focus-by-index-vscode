# Focus By Index

A simple extension which builds on the functionality of `edt active` by allowing you to select files by their index.
This extension is best paired with the `workbench.editor.showTabIndex` setting set to true for easier keyboard
navigation.

## Features

Running the command (`Focus By Index`) or using the shortcut (`ctrl/cmd+alt+i`) will open a list of your currently
opened tabs. You can filter your tabs, *or* if you have fewer than 10 tabs then typing a number will automatically
jump to that tab.
